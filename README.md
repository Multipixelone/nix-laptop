## About

this used to be my temporary flake just for setting up my laptop but my old flake had such poor code quality that this became my default one.

this repo is absolutely **screaming** for a refactor and for a lot of the code to be reorganized and probably an addition of `flake-parts`. a lot of the machine detecting logic was poorly written and written before I realized how to be cognizant and write my own modules.

once I get around to this, it will be a glorious day indeed.
